##Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![](/Deliverable1.png)
After reviewing the output of the linear regression, vehicle length and ground clearance show a p value of less than .05 which means that they provide non-random amounts of variance to the mpg values.

The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero as the p-value is 5.35e-11 which is signficiantly smaller than .05.

Yes, the model does predict the mpg. Based on the adjusted r-squared value of .7149, the model is 71.49% likey to predict the mpg of MechaCare prototypes.
